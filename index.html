    <h2 id="biography">Short Biography</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
       <p>Pauline Boty (6 March 1938 – 1 July 1966) was a British painter. Boty was a founder of the British Pop art movement and the only female painter in the British wing of the movement. Boty's paintings and collages often demonstrated a joy in self-assured femininity and female sexuality and expressed overt or implicit criticism of the "man's world" in which she lived. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pauline Boty was known to be one of the relatively few women artists involved in the Pop Art movement. She is believed to be the founder of the British Pop art. Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced objects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Her first group show, Blake, Boty, Porter, Reeve, took place in November 1961 at A.I.A. gallery in London, where she presented twenty collages, including Is it a bird, is it a plane? and a rose is a rose is a rose. It was one of the first British Pop art shows. In her works, she incorporated images of celebrities into her paintings and also tried to explore female sexuality. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Boty's work is inherently subjective and tied to her own personality - like many Pop Artists, her personality and social life provides important context. Her personal experiences of the society around her provide the subject matter for her paintings, foregrounding an individual perspective on the changing cultural conventions of 1960s Britain often overlooked.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Like many other Pop Artists, Boty was influenced by and participated in several other art forms alongside her painting. Working as a model, actor and dancer, Boty's social circle and its impact on her work reflects the intermingling of artistic forms common in the early 1960s, where musicians, filmmakers, painters and photographers were acutely aware of developments in each other's fields.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>David Mellor exhibited Boty’s work during his show at the Barbican in 1993, and again in a joint Anglo-French exhibition, Brighton, in 1997. A major retrospective exhibition of Boty's artworks was organized at Whitford Fine Art and The Mayor Gallery in London in 1998. Today, her paintings are part of the permanent collection of the Tate Gallery.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pauline Boty was a supporter of feminism. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Due at least in part to the engrained sexism of the art world and prejudice against a woman who unashamedly celebrated her own sexuality, full historical recognition for Boty came late, after her tragic death at the age of only 28.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
